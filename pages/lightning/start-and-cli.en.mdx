It's time to start and initialize LND. Here you need two terminals and with both you are using SSH to get into the Pi. On terminal 1 you start LND with the `lnd` command.

```bash
lnd     
```

On the second terminal we are going to create a wallet. Type:

```bash
lncli create
```

You will enter a process that requires you to provide a password at least 8 characters long. You will be asked if you have an existing seed. Choose `N` (or `Y` if you want to enter an existing seed). After this you will be asked if you want to encrypt the seed with a password. Just do it ðŸ˜‰ Finally you will see the seed. Save it well, as you see instructed in the terminal.

After you initialize a wallet, more text will appear on the first terminal screen.

On the first terminal screen, press `Ctrl + C` to exit LND.

## Restarting

On the first terminal screen, start LND.

```bash
lnd
```

On the second terminal screen, unlock your wallet.

```bash
lncli unlock
```

Enter your password.

## Information about your node

To get an overview of your node including the public key and the URL to the outside world, type the following command.

```bash
lncli getinfo
```

The following is some of the output you will see.

```javascript
{
    "identity_pubkey": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY",
    "alias": "YOURSETTING_A",
    "color": "YOURSETTING_B",
    "uris": ["YOUR_PUBKEY@YOUR_URL.onion:9735" ]
}
```

The output includes your public key and onion address. These things you can share with people to connect.
