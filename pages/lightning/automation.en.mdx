Having two terminals open is irritating. You want LND running in the background, just like bitcoind.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/lnd.service
```

Paste this in there.

```toml
[Unit]
Description=Lightning Network Daemon
Requires=bitcoind.service
After=bitcoind.service

[Service]
User=ubuntu
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/go/bin/lnd
PIDFile=/home/ubuntu/.lnd/lnd.pid
Restart=always
TimeoutSec=180
RestartSec=60

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it again with `Ctrl + X` and confirm with `Y`.

The system should be notified of the new service and can then be started.

```bash
sudo systemctl enable lnd
```

```bash
sudo systemctl start lnd
```

If you want to see if everything started up properly, run this:

```bash
systemctl status lnd
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash
lnd.service - Lightning Network Daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/lnd.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
     Active: active (running) since Sat 2022-01-15 11:19:18 UTC; 1min 24s ago
   Main PID: 73287 (lnd)
      Tasks: 9 (limit: 4203)
     CGroup: /system.slice/lnd.service
             └─73287 /home/ubuntu/go/bin/lnd

Nov 25 17:45:10 raspberrypi systemd[1]: Started Lightning Network Daemon.
```

Press `q` to exit the screen again.

If you want an overview of the status over multiple sessions, use this:

```bash
sudo journalctl -f -u lnd
```

To finish up, you have to unlock LND with your password just like before. The nice thing is that now you don't have to have two terminals open. With `lncli unlock` everything is completed.
