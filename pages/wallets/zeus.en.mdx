There is a [Zeus: Bitcoin/Lightning Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.zeusln.zeus) app available in the Play Store but the project's [alpha release](https://github.com/ZeusLN/zeus/releases) are also great to use. It has a nice interface and you can attach it to your own node via Tor. Since this app uses the REST-api and not RPC-calls (like e.g. Zap) this app feels a bit smoother and also has a bit more functionality.

## Preparation

Since we are running a headless server, we don't have a QR code that we can scan later so we need to paste a connection string. We create this connection string using [lndconnect](/lightning-extensions/lnd-connect) on your Pi. SSH your Pi and type:

```bash
lndconnect --host=xxx.onion --port=8080 -j
```

Where **xxx.onion** says, of course you enter [your onion address](/lightning-extensions/lnd-connect) for LND's **REST** API. A piece of text will appear that looks something like the following:

```bash
lndconnect://xxx.onion:8080?cert=very many_characters&macaroon=very many_characters
```

Copy that chunk of text from SSH and paste it into a Google Docs document, for example (because we'll want to have that text on our phone later).

## Zeus

1. On your phone, switch to this Google Docs document and copy the entire string `lndconnect://xxx.onion:8080?cert=heel_many_characters&macaroon=heel_many_characters`.
2. Open Zeus
3. `GET STARTED`
4. `Connect a node >`
5. `+ ADD A NEW NODE`
6. `IMPORT`
7. Fill in the alias of your node at `Nickname (optional)`.
8. `SAVE NODE CONFIG`

You are now connected to your own Node.
